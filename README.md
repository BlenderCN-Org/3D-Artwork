# 3D-Artwork
Abstracted rooms and items built for isometric renderings in Blender. Trying to remember my findings over time in the Wiki [here](https://github.com/berndpl/3D-Artwork/wiki).

Feel free to use this for inspiration and getting started. And don't forget too share your own learnings and explorations!
